    <h1>i deleted this page and everything if someone sees this please talk to me.</h1>
    <p>
    im feeling useless i know i may be corny/cringe and i will be treated different beacause of this
    but im thinking everyday about k1lling myself and yes i do sh i cant resist i act irl all happy and weird and everyone thinks im just a weirdo with autism.
    i know that u may think that im lying or something but its true i got left out since 2020 i couldnt resist since then and i just started to cry everyday and feel useless
    my parents are sometimes nice but they dont know what i talk about with the ones i actually trust online ,  my irl "friends" left me out because i had autism and being really weird 
    ig that was true i believe them now i listen to music and cry everyday since then. when i get out of school everyone looks at me weird because im walking alone without talking to anyone/making eye contact
    everyday when i get in class everyone yells at me that i should die/not go to school anymore like im just 15 im trying to live thats all i want.
     im dry i cant even talk to people anymore , i literally heard more  "kill yourself" then "i love you" or "how are you doing" .
    If someone sees this i know im cringe/corny please do not mention this / make fun of me for this</p>
